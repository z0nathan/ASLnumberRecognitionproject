##About data preprocessing...
  I wanted to extract significant features from landmark tensor, so I used relative coordinate(oriantation is wrist), and normalized the entire size of the skeleton. 

##data augmantation
  flip&rotation to prevent data bias..

##What I learned
  Importance of stratificaiton  --for trouble shooting
  simplifying the problem  --lower cost to iterate entire procee to solve problem..
